Bloop is an app where users can find public bathrooms in Los Angeles.

## Initialization

Run ``npm install`` to install all dependencies.

## Start Server

Run ``npm run dev`` to concurrently start Vite front-end server and Express.js back-end server.

App will be live at http://localhost:5173/

Close the app with CTRL+C in terminal.

If changes are made to Vite front-end (``/src/*``), the
app will update automatically. If changes are made to express back-end (``/server.js``, ``/vite.config.js``),
you will need to restart the server.
